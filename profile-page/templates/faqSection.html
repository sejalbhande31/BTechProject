                <h3>What is Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)?</h3>

                    interaction, and behavior. It is called a "spectrum" because it presents a wide range of symptoms
                    and levels of severity.

                <h3>What causes autism?</h3>
                <p>The exact cause of autism is not fully understood. It is important to note that vaccines do not cause
                    autism.<br>Other factors that increase the risk of giving birth to a baby with autism include the
                    age of the parents at conception, health conditions such as diabetes and thyroid disease during
                    pregnancy, maternal obesity, etc.<br>

                    According to some researchers, environmental factors may also increase the possibility of having a
                    baby with ASD. Exposure to poisonous substances like mercury, lead, and other heavy metals (from
                    pesticides) can significantly increase the risk.

            <h1>Signs of Autism and Other Characteristics</h1>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h2>1. Communication Difficulties</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Delayed Speech:</strong> Children with autism may have delayed or absent speech. They may struggle to form words or sentences and may not engage in typical conversations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unusual Tone or Pitch:</strong> Some individuals with autism may speak in a monotone voice or use a higher or lower pitch than usual.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>2. Social Interaction Challenges</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Limited Eye Contact:</strong> Individuals with autism often avoid making eye contact or may find it uncomfortable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Difficulty with Social Cues:</strong> Recognizing and responding to social cues, like facial expressions or body language, can be challenging. They might not understand sarcasm, humor, or other non-verbal communication.</li>
                    <li><strong>Preference for Solitude:</strong> Many individuals with autism prefer playing alone or may seem uninterested in interacting with others.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>3. Repetitive Behaviors</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hand Flapping or Rocking:</strong> Some children may engage in repetitive movements, such as hand-flapping, spinning, or rocking back and forth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Strict Routines:</strong> A preference for routines and resistance to changes in their environment or schedule is common. They may become distressed if their routines are disrupted.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>4. Sensory Sensitivities</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Overreaction to Sensory Inputs:</strong> Individuals with autism may be overly sensitive to sounds, lights, textures, or smells. For example, they might cover their ears in response to loud noises or avoid certain fabrics due to sensory discomfort.</li>
                    <li><strong>Underreaction to Pain or Temperature:</strong> Some may have a high tolerance for pain or temperature, not reacting to injuries or extreme cold/heat.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>5. Strong Focus on Specific Interests</h2>
                <p>Many individuals with autism have intense, focused interests in specific subjects or objects, such as trains, numbers, or certain types of animals. They may spend a significant amount of time learning about or engaging with these interests.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>6. Cognitive and Learning Differences</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Varied Intelligence:</strong> People with autism often have a unique cognitive profile. Some may excel in certain areas, such as mathematics, music, or memory, while others may struggle with tasks requiring problem-solving or abstract thinking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Difficulty with Motor Coordination:</strong> Many individuals with autism face challenges with motor skills, such as handwriting, balance, or coordination.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Autism is a spectrum, meaning each individual will display a different combination and intensity of these signs. Early detection and intervention can significantly help in improving outcomes and supporting individuals with autism in leading fulfilling lives.</p>

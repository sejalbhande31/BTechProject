# 🌈 SpectrumCare – Empowering Early Detection & Intervention for Autism

## 🧠 What is SpectrumCare?

**SpectrumCare** is an AI-powered platform designed to **detect early signs of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** in children from infancy to 18 years of age. Using cutting-edge **facial analysis technologies**, 
SpectrumCare provides a non-invasive, data-driven approach to identifying behavioral markers of autism and delivering **personalized intervention plans**.

## 💡 Motivation

Early diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) significantly improves long-term outcomes. However, traditional diagnosis often requires in-person assessments, is expensive, 
and may not be accessible to everyone.

### Key Challenges:
- Late diagnosis and intervention.
- Shortage of specialists in remote areas.
- Subjective evaluation criteria.
- Lack of accessible digital screening tools.

### Our Vision:
> To bridge this gap using **deep learning** and **AI/ML** to empower parents, caregivers, and healthcare professionals with an accessible,
> early diagnostic tool — ensuring **timely, personalized care** for every child.
